A Veronan Echo, in which we echo a character, then output '8', then '-1'.

Romeo, a lovely human.
The Ghost, his counterpart.

Act I: Verona.

Scene I: A fight, maybe.

[Enter Romeo and the Ghost]

The Ghost:
 Open your mind. Speak your mind!

Romeo:
 Thou art as beautiful as a large chihuahua. Thou art
 the sum of thyself and the difference between the square root of my rotund jolly aunt
 and a horrid great calamity. Open your heart.

The Ghost:
 You flirt-gill! Thou art the difference between nothing and the square of thyself! Open your heart!!

[Exeunt]
